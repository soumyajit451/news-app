While most polls in the state opened at 7 a.m., Massachusetts election officials said many Independent voters have already voted early, and that means interest in this election season is high.Secretary of State Bill Galvin said strong feelings about Donald Trump and President Joe Biden are leading voters to the polls.Super Tuesday: Voter guide | What's at stake? | Backward ballot colors | Turnout historyAbout 60 percent of Massachusetts voters are registered as independent. Political experts said those voters may give Republican Nikki Haley a boost in the Bay State. Haley has only won a single primary in Washington, D.C.“I'm cautiously optimistic we'll go over a million by the end of the day,” said Secretary of State Bill Galvin.Galvin cast his primary vote in Brighton Tuesday morning. “At this point, over 365,000 Democratic ballots have been cast by mail, and over 175,000 Republican ballots, which is remarkable in a sense because Republicans have been reluctant to vote by mail in the past,” Galvin said Tuesday morning.Galvin said turnout for the primary is significantly higher compared to the reelection years for both presidents Barack Obama and Trump. After a unanimous U.S. Supreme Court decision to keep Trump on the ballot in states that challenged him, it sends a resounding message the future of the country, is in the hands of the voters.“I think while there may not be a tremendous amount of enthusiasm for the major candidates in both parties, I still think there's a realization of how important this is,” Galvin said. Some voters said they wish there were better options.“I wish there were more people honestly on both sides to give us a better choice,” one voter said. “I voted for Joe Biden. I think he's doing a good job and I'm not comfortable with Trump,” another voter said. “I voted for Nikki Haley because I'm not really a fan of Trump and not really a fan of Biden either,” another voter said. Galvin said there were a few hiccups Tuesday morning. A power outage in one polling location, and an issue with a locked door in another. But both were resolved quickly, and no one was turned away.Nearly 2,300 delegates will be awarded across both parties — 854 for Republicans and 1,420 for Democrats.A candidate would need more than 70 percent of their party's delegates to clinch the nomination.  Voters in all Super Tuesday states will see Trump's name on their ballots after the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously rejected Colorado's attempts to remove Trump from the ballot, citing the 14th Amendment's Insurrection Clause. The ruling also ended similar efforts in Illinois and Maine.The Supreme Court said it's up to Congress to enforce that clause, not the states. Haley campaigned Monday night in Texas, where she was hoping to spark a bit of momentum. Her supporters say they want her in this race, however polls suggest Trump is on track to sweep Tuesday's contests. Biden is not on the campaign trail, but his biggest rival may not even be a candidate.Activists in Massachusetts want Democrats to use the \"No Preference\" option to put pressure on Biden to end fighting in Gaza. Polling places are open to 8 p.m. Local polling places can be found using the Secretary of State’s website.","source":"WCVB Boston","date":"2024-03-05T17:04:00.000Z","props":{"type":"article","url":"https://www.wcvb.com/article/massachusetts-voters-head-to-polls-on-high-stakes-super-tuesday/60089130","site_name":"WCVB","title":"Massachusetts voters head to polls on high-stakes Super Tuesday","description":"Nearly 2,300 delegates will be awarded across both parties — 854 for Republicans and 1,420 for Democrats.","image":"https://kubrick.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/voting-location-65e7521ed6cbb.png?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*","image:width":"1200","image:height":"675"},"language":"EN","created_at":"2024-03-05T17:29:11.878Z","hostname":"wcvb.com","id":"e79f0b1d5befb1392d154992905b6699"},{"_score":1.1161888,"title":"Vicente y Fernanda India gang rape: Influencers recount attack","link":"https://nypost.com/2024/03/05/world-news/vicente-y-fernanda-india-gang-rape-influencers-recount-attack/","description":"The couple, who go by Vicente and Fernanda on their social media pages, say they were set upon by the gang of men who took turns raping Fernanda while they beat Vincente.","body":null,"source":"New York Post ","date":"2024-03-05T17:02:00.000Z","props":{"type":"article","title":"Travel influencer recounts horror gang-rape by 8 men in India — and husband was forced to watch","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/03/05/world-news/vicente-y-fernanda-india-gang-rape-influencers-recount-attack/","description":"“They raped me, they took turns while some watched and they stayed like that for about two hours”, Fernanda told TV interviewers.","site_name":"New York Post","image:width":"1024","image:height":"682","image:alt":"","locale":"en_US","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/77747998.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024","image:secure_url":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/77747998.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024"},"language":"EN","created_at":"2024-03-05T17:26:54.025Z","hostname":"nypost.com","id":"c7fda347c2d8a397e45a028c25c47d07"},{"_score":1.1222962,"title":"Colorectal cancer is on the rise: What to know and how to help | CNN","link":"https://www.cnn.com/colorectal-cancer-is-on-the-rise-what-to-know-and-how-to-help-iyw-wellness/index.html","description":"Here’s a sobering thought:","body":"Here’s a sobering statistic: By 2030, cases of colorectal cancer in people under 50 are expected to nearly double, and it will become the leading cause of death for people age 20 to 49. But there’s good news, too. Overall, colon cancer diagnoses have decreased. Experts attribute that to more cancer screenings. So what can be done to lower rates of the disease in the younger population? And why is it happening in the first place? Younger patients Researchers think that “something happened in the 1950’s and 1960’s” that triggered the current cases of young onset colorectal cancers, according to Dr. Robin Mendelsohn, a gastroenterologist and Co-Director at the Center for Young Onset Colorectal and Gastroinstestinal Cancers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. “I think if it was one answer, we would have figured it out,” says Dr. Mendelsohn. “If it were something obvious, or one major thing, we would have found it.” She thinks it is more likely some combination of behavioral and/or environmental changes. Among the things researchers are looking at: the age of parents at time of the patient’s birth, whether they were born via Caesarean section, whether they were breast fed, antibiotic use – and even wifi exposure. Younger patients tend to get diagnosed at later, more advanced stages of the disease because they’re not being screened and they may have to go through several doctors before they figure out what’s wrong. April’s story April Witzel, a nurse practitioner and midwife, was diagnosed with colorectal cancer at age 45. She didn’t have any obvious risk factors: “I’m female, I’m Caucasian, I didn’t eat a high-meat diet, I didn’t have colon cancer in my family,” she says. Her first symptoms were intense stomach pain and nausea. Then there was blood in her stool – so much blood, she took a picture of the toilet contents and went to the ER. And even though she’s a health professional who spends her days inside the hospital, Witzel didn’t receive the care she expected. “I was having severe pain, and I’m crying, and I had blood in my stool. And he [the doctor] said ‘Are you sure you aren’t on your period?’” A shocked Witzel responded: “I am a woman’s health practitioner. I see more vaginas in a day than you see in a year… I know whether I’m bleeding from vagina or my rectum.” The ER doctor then took another look at her pictures and asked if her she’d “eaten beets recently.” Advocating for yourself “When I think about how much I had to advocate for myself… I had the medical knowledge. I didn’t have the cancer knowledge, but I knew how to navigate the system. So many people don’t. And they just expect that their caregiver is going to do to the right thing,” Witzel says. By the time Witzel got her diagnosis, her disease had spread. “It’s so treatable if it’s caught early. I currently have stage four with metastases to my liver and lungs.” Witzel’s story is an example of what can happen when younger people go in for an appointment and doctors don’t think to test for something usually associated with an older population. Her story may be a worst-case scenario, but she hopes others will learn from her experience and push to receive the care they need. Key differences between young and old patients The majority of younger colorectal cancer patients don’t have family history of the disease, and most of them don’t have a genetic disposition toward it. And while obesity does seem to play a small part in some of these cancers, many of these younger patients are vegetarians; some even marathon runners – lifestyles usually associated with being more protective against developing colorectal cancer. “Our hope in our research is to try to find a high-risk group to do early screening,” says Dr. Mendelsohn. She urges everyone over 45 to get a colonscopy or other screening test. Those mail-away tests are generally reliable and helpful, she says, but there is a reason why colonoscopies remain the gold-standard: “In general, stool-based tests are as good as colonoscopies for early detection of cancer. But they’re not as good at finding polyps. [With a colonoscopy] you can get them [the polyps] removed at the time,” says Mendelsohn. Ultimately, says Dr. Mendelsohn: “Colorectal screening saves lives. If you’re younger than screening age, know your family history. We are working hard to figure this out, and there’s hope on the horizon that we will figure it out.” African Americans at increased risk Black men and women are particularly at risk for developing colorectal cancer. Timothy Mitchell was 43 years old when he was diagnosed. “The older generation didn’t talk about what was going on, which was a disservice to us,” Mitchell says. “It was almost a hush-hush thing.” Knowing your family history is important and can save your life. In Mitchell’s case, his relatives didn’t always talk about why family members were in the hospital, what illnesses they had, and what their symptoms were. “What goes on in the house, stays in the house. We don’t tell people our business,” Mitchell says. For him, that could have been fatal. “Because we don’t know what to look for, because I had Lynch syndrome, and until I talked to my auntie, I didn’t know that so many people in my father’s family had so much cancer.” That Lynch syndrome put Mitchell at an increased risk for colorectal cancer, something he didn’t realize. Now he plans to encourage his sons get their first colonoscopies in their early 30’s. (Doctors generally recommend children of colon cancer patients receive their first colonoscopies about 10 years before their parent’s age of diagnosis.) Mitchell, an avid motorcycle rider, regularly approaches other bikers and strikes up conversations about colonoscopies. Not your usual biker talk, perhaps, but potentially life-saving. “People hear they have cancer and they think they’re gonna die. You should not feel like it’s a death sentence,” he says. “Cancer is detectable, treatable and beatable, says Mitchell. What you need to do Knowing your family history and talking about it is important. A family history of Lynch syndrome or colon cancer is something you should be aware of, so you can be screened early. Anyone experiencing a significant change in bowel habits, or anyone who sees blood in their stool, should consult a doctor. “Most people don’t talk about their poop; it’s not good dinner conversation,” admits Dr. Mendelsohn. Most rectal bleeding does not turn out be cancer, stresses Dr. Mendelsohn, but you should always be checked. Find a doctor you feel comfortable with, who’s taking your concerns seriously. “You don’t want to talk about bodily functions,” admits Witzel, the nurse who wasn’t taken seriously. “It tends to be an embarrassing thing. But I will share my story every day if it saves one person.” How to help If you’d like to help colorectal cancer patients, click HERE or use the form below:","source":"CNN","date":"2024-03-05T16:43:00.000Z","props":{"title":"Colorectal cancer is on the rise: What to know and how to help | CNN","image":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170807172633-colorectal-cancer-1.jpg?q=x_5,y_239,h_2587,w_4598,c_crop/w_800","type":"article","url":"https://www.cnn.com/colorectal-cancer-is-on-the-rise-what-to-know-and-how-to-help-iyw-wellness/index.html","site_name":"CNN"},"language":"EN","created_at":"2024-03-05T17:26:34.668Z","hostname":"cnn.com","id":"219236a8485b5f4b92b2fc809951e76c"},{"_score":1.1113143,"title":"Credit card late fees capped at $8 under new Biden admin rule | Fox Business","link":"https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/credit-card-late-fees-capped-new-biden-admin-rule","description":"The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau finalized a rule Tuesday that will cap all credit card late fees at $8, a move that could save families millions.","body":"The Biden administration on Tuesday finalized a new rule to cap all credit card late fees at $8, a move that is expected to elicit fierce pushback from industry giants.&#xA0; The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau estimates the new regulation will save American families more than $10 billion in late fees annually by reducing the typical late fee of about $32. That amounts to an average saving of roughly $220 per year for the 45 million people who are charged late fees.&#xA0; The rule applies to the country&apos;s largest credit card issuers, which covers those with more than 1 million open accounts. These companies represent about 95% of total outstanding credit card balances. While smaller credit card issuers tend to charge lower rates and fees to their borrowers, the CFPB said that large issuers charge close to the maximum allowable late fee amount.&#xA0; CREDIT CARD DELINQUENCIES SURGE AS AMERICANS BATTLE HIGH INFLATION, INTEREST RATES  The crackdown on late fees is part of a broader initiative by the Biden administration to limit so-called junk fees, which are sometimes hidden surcharges that consumers pay on everything from credit cards to loans to hotel rooms. Earlier this year, federal regulators rolled out a proposal to sharply cut overdraft fees charged by banks. The White House is also trying to lower costs for voters as they continue to grapple with still-high inflation that has sent the cost of everyday necessities soaring.&#xA0; While inflation has fallen considerably from a peak of 9.1% notched during June 2022, it remains well above the Federal Reserve&apos;s 2% goal. When compared with January 2021, shortly before the inflation crisis began, prices are up a stunning 17.6%.&#xA0; A FED PAUSE LIKELY WON&#x2019;T HELP STRUGGLING CONSUMERS  &quot;For over a decade, credit card giants have been exploiting a loophole to harvest billions of dollars in junk fees from American consumers,&quot; said Rohit Chopra, CFPB director. &quot;Today&apos;s rule ends the era of big credit card companies hiding behind the excuse of inflation when they hike fees on borrowers and boost their own bottom lines.&quot; However, major financial institutions slammed the latest rule targeting credit card late fees, warning that it could ultimately hurt consumers by reducing competition, increasing the cost of credit, causing more people to pay late and reducing credit access for those who need it more. GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE &quot;The Bureau&#x2019;s misguided decision to cap credit card late fees at a level far below banks&#x2019; actual costs will force card issuers to reduce credit lines, tighten standards for new accounts and raise APRs for all consumers &#x2013; even those who pay on time,&quot; said Rob Nichols, the president and CEO of the American Bankers Association. The American Bankers Association pledged that it would fight the &quot;harmful consumer policy&quot; by the CFPB, while the Chamber of Commerce said it would &quot;immediately&quot; file a lawsuit against the CFPB.","source":"Fox Business","date":"2024-03-05T16:31:00.000Z","props":{"title":"Credit card late fees capped at $8 under new Biden admin rule","description":"The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau finalized a rule Tuesday that will cap all credit card late fees at $8, a move that could save families millions.","type":"article","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2023/11/0/0/Visa-Credit-Cards-GettyImages-1138920722.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","url":"https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/credit-card-late-fees-capped-new-biden-admin-rule","site_name":"Fox Business"},"language":"EN","created_at":"2024-03-05T17:27:25.787Z","hostname":"foxbusiness.com","id":"ecc67597f14974c17645d3c344bc81ed"},{"_score":1.1113143,"title":"Option bonus gives Broncos flexibility in splitting Russell Wilson cap charge - NBC Sports","link":"https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/option-bonus-gives-broncos-flexibility-in-splitting-russell-wilson-cap-charge","description":"Over the next two years, the Broncos will take $85 million in cap charges for quarterback Russell Wilson.","body":null,"source":"NBC Sports","date":"2024-03-05T16:27:38.000Z","props":{"title":"Option bonus gives Broncos flexibility in splitting Russell Wilson cap charge","url":"https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/option-bonus-gives-broncos-flexibility-in-splitting-russell-wilson-cap-charge","image":"https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d55ee5f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1080+0+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhdliveextra-a.akamaihd.net%2FHD%2Fimage_sports%2FNBCU_Sports_Group_-_nbcsports%2F504%2F215%2Fnbc_pft_russellwilson_240305.jpg","image:url":"https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d55ee5f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1080+0+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhdliveextra-a.akamaihd.net%2FHD%2Fimage_sports%2FNBCU_Sports_Group_-_nbcsports%2F504%2F215%2Fnbc_pft_russellwilson_240305.jpg","image:width":"1440","image:height":"810","image:type":"image/jpeg","image:alt":"nbc_pft_russellwilson_240305.jpg","description":"Over the next two years, the Broncos will take $85 million in cap charges for quarterback Russell Wilson.","site_name":"NBC Sports","type":"article"},"language":"EN","created_at":"2024-03-05T17:20:59.837Z","hostname":"nbcsports.com","id":"491d5066e8e1a95ad2700f286383bca1"},{"_score":1.1171646,"title":"Clinton Township fire: Teen hit, killed by flying combustible","link":"https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/macomb/2024/03/05/select-distributor-explosions-teen-dies/72849661007/","description":"A 19-year-old bystander died early Tuesday morning as a result of a massive fire at Select Distributors in Clinton Township, according to officials.","body":null,"source":"Detroit Free Press","date":"2024-03-05T16:22:43.000Z","props":{"title":"Clinton Township fire: Teen killed by flying canister amid Select Distributors explosions","description":"A 19-year-old bystander died early Tuesday morning as a result of a massive fire at Select Distributors in Clinton Township, according to officials.","url":"https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/macomb/2024/03/05/select-distributor-explosions-teen-dies/72849661007/","site_name":"Detroit Free Press","image":"https://www.freep.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/03/05/PDTF/72849959007-explosion-030524-04-mw.jpg?crop=2399,1351,x0,y124&width=2399&height=1351&format=pjpg&auto=webp","image:width":"2399","image:height":"1351","type":"article"},"language":"EN","created_at":"2024-03-05T17:20:59.564Z","hostname":"freep.com","id":"7656293a03863ef760e9215ce89acc70"},{"_score":1.1233623,"title":"Warner Bros.

Discovery gaming boss J.B. Perrette discussed some of the company&#039;s strategy for gaming going forward, and it includes more live-service, mobile, and free-to-play games. He said, &quot;We&#039;re doubling down on games as an area where we think there is a lot more growth opportunity that we can tap into with the IP that we have and some of the capabilities we have on the studio where we&#039;re uniquely positioned as both a publisher and a developer of games.&quot; Perrette said WBD&#039;s recent gaming output has focused on AAA games for console, and that&#039;s great when a game like Hogwarts Legacy sells 22 million copies and becomes the best-selling game of the year, but this kind of success is never guaranteed in what Perrette said was a &quot;volatile&quot; market. He pointed out that one of WBD&#039;s latest big games, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, was a disappointment for the company. So the plan going forward, he said, is to help reduce volatility by focusing on core franchises and bringing at least some of them to the mobile and free-to-play space, as well as continuing to invest in live-service games that people play--and spend money on--over a long period of time. This will help WBD generate more consistent revenue, he said, going on to tease that WBD had some new mobile free-to-play games coming this year. Also worth noting is that just because WBD may push into new places, that doesn&#039;t necessarily mean it will stop making big single-player AAA games.  &quot;Rather than just launching a one-and-done console game, how do we develop a game around, for example, a Hogwarts Legacy or Harry Potter, that is a live-service where people can live and work and build and play in that world in an ongoing basis?&quot; he said. Perrette went on to say that WBD is uniquely positioned because it has popular brands--he singled out Mortal Kombat, Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, and DC as its biggest--as well as 11 different internal game development studios. He also teased that WBD has a &quot;strategic investment plan&quot; to help make future games more successful, adding that the company just recently brought someone on to help with brand management and sustainability. If WBD can execute, Perrette said he expects gaming to bring &quot;meaningful growth&quot; to the company in the years to come. But making games takes time, so Perrette cautioned that the company is laying the foundation now for returns that could come in 2025, 2026, and 2027. Perrette went on to say how he has no idea how the gaming landscape will evolve over time, but he believes owning the IP and studios could help WBD succeed where others might not. He also called out things like virtual reality and &quot;virtual worlds&quot; as places that will &quot;increase in scale and adoption&quot; in the future. Some of WBD&#039;s upcoming video games include a Harry Potter Quidditch game and a Wonder Woman title from the makers of Shadow of Mordor. WBD&#039;s approach to gaming is very different to Disney&#039;s. The company, years ago, developed and published games in-house, but now licenses its franchises to other companies. For example, Disney just paid Epic $1.5 billion to bring its franchises to Fortnite. Disney is also working with a variety of companies, including EA, Ubisoft, Zynga, and Quantic Dream on Star Wars games, and has a deal with Microsoft&amp;#47;Bethesda for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Blade.","source":"GameSpot","date":"2024-03-05T16:16:10.000Z","props":{"image":"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/1179/11799911/4268698-screenshot2024-03-05at9.55.50am.png","title":"Warner Bros.

The government said it would try to track down the escaped inmates, including from a penitentiary were the vast majority were in pre-trial detention, with some accused of slayings, kidnappings and other crimes.\"The police were ordered to use all legal means at their disposal to enforce the curfew and apprehend all offenders,\" said a statement from Finance Minister Patrick Boivert, the acting prime minister.Gangs already were estimated to control up to 80% of Port-au-Prince, the capital. They are increasingly coordinating their actions and choosing once unthinkable targets like the Central Bank.Prime Minister Ariel Henry traveled to Kenya last week to try to salvage support for a United Nations-backed security force to help stabilize Haiti in its conflict with the increasingly powerful crime groups.Dujarric said the secretary-general stressed the need for urgent action, especially in providing financial support for the mission, \"to address the pressing security requirements of the Haitian people and prevent the country from plunging further into chaos.\"Haiti's National Police has roughly 9,000 officers to provide security for more than 11 million people, according to the U.N. They are routinely overwhelmed and outgunned.Ulrika Richardson, UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Haiti, reported that last year saw \"a very steep increase\" in murders, lynchings, rape and other violence committed by gang members. This trend has continued into 2024, with January being the most violent month in two years, she added, echoing recent findings by the UN human rights office.The United Nations' immigration office said at least 15,000 people had been displaced due to violence.\"Armed gangs forced us to leave our homes. They destroyed our houses, and we're on the streets,\" a man named Nicolas told the Reuters news agency.\"Please, please help us\"The deadly weekend marked a new low in Haiti's downward spiral of violence. At least nine people had been killed since Thursday - four of them police officers - as gangs stepped up coordinated attacks on state institutions in Port-au-Prince, including the international airport and national soccer stadium.But the attack on the National Penitentiary late Saturday shocked Haitians. All but 98 of the 3,798 inmates being held at the penitentiary escaped, according to the Office of Citizen Protection. Meanwhile, at the Croix-des-Bouquets prison, 1,033 escaped, including 298 convicts.The office said late Monday that it was seriously concerned about the safety of judges, prosecutors, victims, attorneys and others following the mass escape.It added that it \"deplored and condemned the policy of nonchalance\" demonstrated by government officials amid the attacks.Following the raid at the penitentiary, three bodies with gunshot wounds lay at the prison entrance Sunday.In another neighborhood, the bloodied corpses of two men with their hands tied behind the backs lay face down as residents walked past roadblocks set up with burning tires.Among the few dozen people who chose to stay in prison are 18 former Colombian soldiers accused of working as mercenaries in the July 2021 assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moïse.\"Please, please help us,\" one of the men, Francisco Uribe, said in a message widely shared on social media. \"They are massacring people indiscriminately inside the cells.\"Colombia's foreign ministry has called on Haiti to provide \"special protection\" for the men.A second Port-au-Prince prison containing around 1,400 inmates also was overrun.Gunfire was reported in several neighborhoods in the capital. Internet service for many residents was down on Sunday as Haiti's top mobile network said a fiber optic cable connection was slashed during the rampage.After gangs opened fire at Haiti's international airport last week, the U.S. Embassy said it was halting all official travel to the country. On Sunday night, it urged all American citizens to depart as soon as possible.The Biden administration, which has refused to commit troops to any multinational force for Haiti while offering money and logistical support, said it was monitoring the rapidly deteriorating security situation with grave concern.The surge in attacks follows violent protests that turned deadlier in recent days as the prime minister went to Kenya seeking to move ahead on the proposed U.N.-backed security mission to be led by that East African country.Henry took over as prime minister following Moise's assassination and has postponed plans to hold parliamentary and presidential elections, which haven't happened in almost a decade.Jimmy Chérizier, a former elite police officer known as Barbecue who now runs a gang federation, has claimed responsibility for the surge in attacks. He said the goal is to capture Haiti's police chief and government ministers and prevent Henry's return.The prime minister has shrugged off calls for him to resign and didn't comment when asked if he felt it was safe to come home.Haitian Americans are stuck in Haiti The U.S. State Department has issued multiple travel warnings urging Americans and State Department employees to stay put and be careful while on the island.At Miami and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airports, all flights in and out of Haiti's two airports are canceled, CBS Miami reported. Despite many warnings, countless Haitian Americans are still on the island. For them, Haiti is home and leaving is complicated.The sister of CBS News Miami's Tania Francois is one of those people. \"I've been stuck in my city where I'm living now for about two months,\" she said. \"Trying to make it into Port Au Prince so I can fly to the States, and I just can't leave.\"Kareen Ulysse  who operates Centre Hospitalier de Fontaine, a hospital and orphanage in Cite Soleil, a suburb of Port au Prince, is also a Haitian American working in Haiti, CBS Miami reported.\"We work literally in the ghettos for the most vulnerable people and there's no help, there's no one really standing in line to help people like them,\" she said.Last August, the U.S. Embassy in Haiti closed due to gunfire nearby, after months of ceaseless violence at the hands of gangs drove thousands of Haitians onto the streets to demand security.","source":"CBS News","date":"2024-03-05T16:09:50.000Z","props":{"type":"article","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/haiti-gangs-try-to-seize-airport-thousands-inmates-escape-prisons-state-of-emergency/","title":"Gangs in Haiti try to seize control of main airport as thousands escape prisons: \"Massacring people indiscriminately\"","description":"Heavily armed gangs in Haiti are increasingly coordinating their actions and choosing once unthinkable targets like the Central Bank.","image":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/03/05/41916a6b-656a-40dc-9046-302a8d466220/thumbnail/1200x630/063572d885abcb2e7be37c287c47df64/2024-03-05t003139z-1600955563-rc25f6au6gks-rtrmadp-3-haiti-violence.jpg?v=bc5d8c67ac570dce258200b20849fb01","image:width":"1200","image:height":"630","video:url":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/2024/03/04/2314059843559/2730520_hls/master.m3u8","video:secure_url":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/2024/03/04/2314059843559/2730520_hls/master.m3u8","video:type":"application/x-mpegURL","video:width":"1920","video:height":"1080"},"language":"EN","created_at":"2024-03-05T17:26:53.928Z","hostname":"cbsnews.com","id":"932fe59b35ea20057b39f8a69397b822"},{"_score":1.1297818,"title":"Ice-free summers in Arctic possible within next decade, scientists say | Arctic | The Guardian","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/05/ice-free-summers-in-arctic-possible-within-next-decade-scientists-say","description":"Home of polar bears, seals and walruses could be mostly water for months as early as 2035 due to fossil fuel emissions","body":null,"source":"The Guardian","date":"2024-03-05T16:02:00.000Z","props":{"url":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/05/ice-free-summers-in-arctic-possible-within-next-decade-scientists-say","image:width":"1200","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6674859a28c46a8cef88a2f5c28be740ca83468c/0_245_7340_4404/master/7340.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b44ed88eddf9ec4e5c9cb65b08fa1c23","title":"Ice-free summers in Arctic possible within next decade, scientists say","image:height":"720","description":"Home of polar bears, seals and walruses could be mostly water for months as early as 2035 due to fossil fuel emissions","type":"article","site_name":"the Guardian"},"language":"EN","created_at":"2024-03-05T17:25:44.660Z","hostname":"theguardian.com","id":"a9e5ab48fe0db7a05930863d06ee32ce"},{"_score":1.1303407,"title":"U.S. bans maker of spyware that targeted a senator's phone","link":"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/us-bans-maker-spyware-targeted-senators-phone-rcna141855","description":"The Treasury Department on Tuesday banned a notorious creator of software that can hack smartphones and turn them into surveillance devices from doing business in the United States.","body":"The Treasury Department on Tuesday banned a notorious creator of software that can hack smartphones and turn them into surveillance devices from doing business in the United States. The sanctions constitute the most aggressive action taken by the U.S. government against a spyware company. The company, Intellexa, develops a software called Predator, which can take over a person’s phone and turn it into a surveillance device. Predator and other major spyware programs boast capabilities such as secretly turning on the user’s microphone and camera, downloading their files without their knowledge and tracking their location. Under the sanctions, Americans and people who do business with the U.S. are forbidden from transacting with Intellexa, its founder and architect Tal Dilian, employee Sara Hamou and four companies affiliated with Intellexa.  In a press call previewing the sanctions, a White House official, who requested to not be identified, said the decision to sanction Intellexa “goes beyond actions we’ve taken.” “This is the first time that the U.S. government has leveraged any sanctions authority against commercial spyware vendors for enabling misuse of their tools,” he said. An Amnesty International investigation found that Predator has been used to target journalists, human rights workers and some high-level political figures, including European Parliament President Roberta Metsola and Taiwan’s outgoing president, Tsai Ing-Wen. The report found that Predator was also deployed against at least two sitting members of Congress, Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, and  Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D. Predator was also central to a scandal that rocked Greece in 2022 in which dozens of politicians and journalists were reportedly targeted with the spyware. NBC News was unable to reach Intellexa for comment. Its website has been offline since sometime in 2023. Multiple governments around the world “have deployed this technology to facilitate repression and enable human rights abuses, including to intimidate political opponents and curb dissent, limit freedom of expression, and monitor and target activists and journalists,” a Treasury Department press release on the sanctions said. The sanctions follow President Joe Biden’s 2023 executive order regulating commercial spyware.  Under that order, the Commerce Department previously placed another spyware developer, the Israeli company NSO Group, on the U.S. entity list, subjecting it to additional regulations. But sanctioning Intellexa is an escalation, said John Scott-Railton, a senior spyware researcher at the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab. “The U.S. using Treasury sanctions is going to be a thunderclap for the spyware world,” he said. “Suddenly this has big, personal consequences.”  “This is the kind of stuff that causes people to consider changing lines of work and leaving countries,” he said.","source":"NBC News","date":"2024-03-05T16:01:58.000Z","props":{"site_name":"NBC News","locale":"en_US","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/us-bans-maker-spyware-targeted-senators-phone-rcna141855","title":"U.S. bans maker of spyware that targeted a senator's phone","description":"The Treasury Department banned the company, Intellexa, from doing business in the United States.","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-01/240104-doj-2022-ac-458p-8aa17e.jpg","image:secure_url":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-01/240104-doj-2022-ac-458p-8aa17e.jpg","image:type":"image/jpeg","image:width":"1200","image:height":"630","type":"article"},"language":"EN","created_at":"2024-03-05T17:26:54.182Z","hostname":"nbcnews.com","id":"cc2f81d5409462fd521f3bf83a205839"},{"_score":1.1233623,"title":"Dodge muscle cars live on with new versions of the Charger powered by electricity or gasoline","link":"https://www.yahoo.com/news/dodge-muscle-cars-live-versions-160039997.html","description":"America's muscle car culture will live on as the country transitions to electric vehicles, but the gas-powered performance car will last for at least a few more years.

Compared with people who got seven to eight hours of sleep per day, those who slept less than six hours daily had a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life, according to the study published Tuesday in the journal JAMA Network Open. “Previous research has shown that (insufficient rest on a daily basis) increases the risk of type 2 diabetes, while healthy dietary habits such as regularly eating fruit and vegetables can reduce the risk,” Dr. Diana Nôga, first author of the study and a sleep researcher in the department of pharmaceutical biosciences at Uppsala University in Sweden, said in a news release. “However, it has remained unclear whether people who sleep too little can reduce their risk of developing type 2 diabetes by eating healthily,” Nôga added. The authors believe they are the first researchers to attempt to answer that question. The study’s findings draw from a large group of participants — nearly 247,900 people who had participated in the UK Biobank study, which has followed the health outcomes of more than half a million people between ages 40 and 69 in the United Kingdom for at least 10 years. At the beginning, participants answered questionnaires about their dietary habits and about how many hours they slept every 24 hours, including naps. The criteria for a healthy diet included having eaten two or more pieces of fruit daily, two or more servings of fish weekly, or 4 or more tablespoons of vegetables per day.   The criteria also included eating no more than two servings each of unprocessed or processed red meat weekly — in other words, someone who ate both one serving of unprocessed red meat and one serving of processed red meat within one week could still be considered to have a healthy diet. Each healthy dietary behavior was worth one point, resulting in a score ranging from zero (unhealthiest) to five (healthiest). Sleeping seven to eight hours daily was defined as normal sleep duration, while six hours was classified as short, moderate as five hours and “extreme short” as three to four hours. By the end of the follow-up period, which was 12.5 years on average, 7,905 participants had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Those who’d slept less than six hours daily were nearly twice as likely to develop the disease than those who had slept a normal amount, the authors found. In terms of risk for type 2 diabetes, there wasn’t a significant difference between those with normal sleep and those who slept six hours. And even for those who ate the healthiest, their diet didn’t offset the effects of insufficient sleep on diabetes risk. “This is another study that shows while genetics play a role in the development of chronic diseases such as diabetes, lifestyle factors matter a lot, too,” Dr. Leana Wen, CNN wellness contributor, an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health, said via email. Wen wasn’t involved in the study. “Much of the time, though, people think of lifestyle factors like dietary intake and exercise habits,” Wen added. The study adds support for “just how important sleep is to preventing chronic diseases.” Sleep and diabetes risk The study’s design means the findings confirm a link between poor sleep and diabetes, not a cause-and-effect relationship, said Dr. Naveed Sattar, a professor of cardiometabolic medicine in the school of cardiovascular and metabolic health at the University of Glasgow in Scotland, via email. The findings are also based on participants’ recollections of their food and sleep habits, according to the study. Confirming a causal relationship “would require randomized trials intervening on sleeping habits to increase sleep time and see if this reduces risk of diabetes in those at risk, e.g. those with pre-diabetes,” Sattar added.   However, “there is now plentiful evidence that short sleep influences appetite regulation and leads to overconsumption of calories, perhaps more dense in nature,” Sattar added. Sleep has also been linked to the function of glucose metabolism, Wen said, which is involved in the cause of type 2 diabetes. Getting enough rest can be difficult, but adjusting your nightly routine can help — starting with establishing consistent sleep and wake times, and a dark, cool and quiet environment. A wind-down ritual — such as reading a book instead of scrolling through social media or taking a warm bath or shower — can get your brain in the right headspace for sleep. Also avoid caffeine at least six hours before bedtime or drinking alcohol before bed. Although it may help you fall asleep, it can interfere with getting into deeper stages of sleep throughout the night.","source":"CNN","date":"2024-03-05T16:00:00.000Z","props":{"title":"How sleep can affect diabetes risk, according to new study | CNN","image":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1411640794.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","type":"article","url":"https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/05/health/short-sleep-diet-diabetes-risk-study-wellness/index.html","site_name":"CNN"},"language":"EN","created_at":"2024-03-05T17:26:34.911Z","hostname":"cnn.com","id":"d29d87c5f59244fd11eed0dae518160e"},{"_score":1.1275613,"title":"Cameron Diaz To Co-Star With Keanu Reeves In 'Outcome' From Jonah Hill","link":"https://deadline.com/2024/03/cameron-diaz-keanu-reeves-apple-original-films-outcome-director-jonah-hill-1235845347/","description":"Cameron Diaz is in final negotiations to join Apple's Outcome movie starring Keanu Reeves and directed by Jonah Hill.","body":"EXCLUSIVE: After landing the coveted package last year, Apple Original Films is putting together quite the cast for Jonah Hill&#8216;s dark comedy Outcome.

It’s gone to sea, war, space, alternate timelines, and the end (and subsequent reboot) of the world. Most importantly, it recently hosted a Lady Gaga takeover. With its upcoming season 5 though, Fortnite is taking a classical approach to its theme and venturing to the land of Greek mythology.\n\n\nOver the weekend, a giant hand emerged from the ground near an in-game amphitheater (clever!) with a chest in its clutches, prompting players to crack it open. Players, who have been keen to the incoming Greek theme due to the usual drip-feed of teases from Epic and leaks from dataminers, proceeded to spend the weekend shooting the chest, which boasted a health pool the size of Mount Olympus. When it finally reached zero, the box opened and a fiery vortex erupted from its contents. Turns out that wasn’t just any average chest, but in fact, Pandora’s Box. And Fortnite players unleashed it. You know, that thing the mythology and retellings of it have always warned against. Way to go, y’all.\n\nNow, the battle pass skins have—in traditional fashion—leaked just ahead of season 5, set to kick off on March 8, further confirming the Greek theme. Among the skins are some staples of Greek mythology, such as Zeus, Aphrodite, and Medusa, the latter of which will reportedly have at least two skin variants available Odyssey, an NPC who sprung up in the game around the same time as the giant hand and Greek-themed changes to the map, will also seemingly receive a skin that will be a free reward for ranked play next season. Other skins on the battle pass seem to run through most of the pantheon, including Hades, Artemis, Ares, and Aphrodite. Even Cerberus seems to make an appearance.\n\nOne of the more significant rumors circulating around the Greek-themed season is that Epic might introduce an alternate skin for God of War protagonist Kratos, who already received a skin years ago that’s in line with his appearance in the most recent set of games. According to said rumors, Kratos’ alternate skin would be a throwback to his appearance in the beginning of the series, when he took on the Greek pantheon. Just please, no one recreate the end of Kratos’ fight with Poseidon in Fortnite. Once truly was enough.\n\nThis next season will be the first new one since the beginning of Fortnite Chapter 5, which brought with it three new games within Fortnite: Fortnite Festival, Rocket Racing, and Lego Fortnite.

Listing the motives for the Palestinian militant group's Oct. 7 massacre in Israel, he accused Jews of \"bringing red cows\" to the Holy Land.The cows he was talking about are red heifers, which now graze at a secure, undisclosed location in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Some Jews and Christians believe they're key to rebuilding the Jewish temple that once stood in Jerusalem, and to beckoning the Messiah.To understand, you have to look back almost 2,000 years in the tumultuous history of the Middle East, when the ancient Romans destroyed the last temple in Jerusalem.To rebuild it, fervent believers point to the Bible's Book of Numbers, which commands the Israelites to offer \"a red heifer without defect or blemish and that has never been under a yoke.\"Only with that offering, they insist, can the temple rise again.From Texas to the West BankInstrumental in bringing the heifers to the Holy Land was Yitshak Mamo, of Uvne Jerusalem, a group committed to seeing a new temple built in Jerusalem's Old City.\"You can check to see if they have any white or black hairs,\" he told CBS News, explaining that any hair that isn't red would disqualify the cows from fulfilling their prophesied role.Finding the red heifers took years. The quest led Mamo not to Jewish breeders but to Christian ranchers thousands of miles away.\"After a long search, we found them in Texas,\" he said. \"Texas red angus.\"To bypass strict laws in place at the time that banned the export of U.S. cattle to Israel, the heifers were classified as pets, Mamo said with a laugh. But to those following biblical commandments, the cows are no laughing matter, he added, stressing that it was no publicity stunt.\"Harry Potter is a good story. The Bible is not a story,\" he said. \"The Bible is a way of God to lead us.\"But while they're classed as pets, there are no plans to let the red heifers live out long happy lives.A massive white altar awaits, where they are to be burned on a plot of land overlooking the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem. Mamo said the ceremony must be performed looking directly into where the ancient Second Temple stood, until it was destroyed by the Romans in the year 70.\"A Pandora's box that nobody can close\"What Mamo didn't mention is what stands in the temple's place now: The Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa Mosque, which are among the holiest sites in Islam.Today, heavily armed guards ensure that only Muslims are allowed inside the complex. But that hasn't stopped Jewish activists, like Melissa Jane Kronfeld, from leading groups up the Temple Mount five days every week.\"There's one true God, and it started here,\" she said, before falling to her knees and bowing where the First Temple, or the Temple of Solomon, was built in 957 BCE. The Second Temple, or Temple of Herod, was a reconstructed version of the first, built in the 6th century BCE, according to scripture.\"It's so important for the Jews to return and rebuild the temple,\" said New York native Kronfeld, who founded the High on the Har organization to lead the tours. \"It's not about taking anything from our Muslim brothers and sisters. It's not about the destruction of Islamic holy sites. It's about preserving this place and being guardians over the house of God for all people.\"But she makes no secret about what she wants to happen to the Dome of the Rock.\"I believe it's going to go, 100%. The whole thing is going to go to build a temple,\" she said, insisting that the shrine and its golden dome should be preserved, but relocated.It's a suggestion that many fear, if acted upon, could make the current war even bloodier, and see it spread rapidly beyond the Gaza Strip.\"Everyone says that the building, the Third Temple, is what will bring the war, it would destabilize the Middle East,\" she said. \"The Middle East seems pretty destabilized right now, and the war, if I'm not mistaken, is already here.\"To be clear, Kronfeld's dream of seeing a Third Temple constructed on the site is just that, a dream, and it is not shared by the Israeli government or by the vast majority of Israelis or Jews. But the suggestion has been more than enough to incite numerous Islamist groups.Hamas dubbed its Oct. 7 terror attack on Israel \"the Al-Aqsa Wave,\" and the group's emblem features the Dome of the Rock behind two crossed swords.While most Muslims do not support Hamas' violence, they do share its unwavering devotion to sacred ground, says Mustafa Abu Sway, the Imam Al-Ghazali Chair at the Al-Aqsa Mosque.\"Al-Aqsa Mosque belongs to all Muslims,\" he said. \"So, you will find reactions from Indonesia to Toronto to New York. Today there are 2 billion Muslims worldwide.\"He told CBS News that removing Al-Aqsa or the Dome of the Rock was \"unimaginable,\" and warned that it would be \"opening a Pandora's box that nobody can close.\"U.S. evangelicals, the cows, and the second comingJewish activists have not been deterred by Hamas' Oct. 7 massacre or the ongoing war in Gaza. Some have been using the conflict as a backdrop to promote their cause in the United States. At the recent National Gathering for Prayer and Repentance in Washington, D.C., Mamo spoke of his heifers and his hopes for a Third Jewish Temple. The gathering was convened by U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, who gave a keynote prayer before a who's-who of evangelical leaders and congresspeople spoke. Many American evangelicals believe the red heifers will usher the second coming of Christ.\"We're going to accept the Messiah, and we need the Messiah to come,\" Byron Stinson, a Texan who helped bring the cows to Israel, said at the gathering. \"For me, the red heifer is red for the blood of Jesus Christ. That's why it's red.\"Back at his settlement in the West Bank, Mamo told CBS News the heifers need only pass a final purity test. The ceremony that he hopes will resurrect the temple and usher in the Messiah could take place any day. He said he understands why Hamas could be outraged.\"But I cannot understand, even if they are right, why they have to slaughter and rape people to win their war,\" he said. \"Terrorists have been attacking us before we ever dreamed of these cows,\" he reflects. \"They don't need them as an excuse to kill.\"","source":"CBS News","date":"2024-03-05T15:48:31.000Z","props":{"type":"article","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-war-hamas-red-heifers-from-texas-jerusalem-jewish-temple-al-aqsa/","title":"What these red cows from Texas have to do with war and peace in the Middle East","description":"Some Jews and Christians believe these Texas red heifers are the key to rebuilding a Jewish temple in Jerusalem, and to beckoning the Messiah.","image":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/03/02/534c78d3-84ae-4903-a7c6-8dc0f5f7a81d/thumbnail/1200x630/1d03d10abf13b5d7e3e3c4f52a9cd810/0302-satmo-sacredcows-livesay-2727712-640x360.jpg?v=bc5d8c67ac570dce258200b20849fb01","image:width":"1200","image:height":"630","video:url":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/2024/03/02/2313786947572/2727709_hls/master.m3u8","video:secure_url":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/2024/03/02/2313786947572/2727709_hls/master.m3u8","video:type":"application/x-mpegURL","video:width":"1920","video:height":"1080"},"language":"EN","created_at":"2024-03-05T16:09:53.932Z","hostname":"cbsnews.com","id":"60f635c98038de0ec3df5445290fda25"},{"_score":1.1161888,"title":"Mavericks vs. Pacers odds, line, spread, score prediction, time: 2024 NBA picks for March 5 from proven model - CBSSports.com","link":"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/mavericks-vs-pacers-odds-line-spread-score-prediction-time-2024-nba-picks-for-march-5-from-proven-model/","description":"SportsLine's model just revealed its NBA picks for Indiana Pacers vs. Dallas Mavericks on Tuesday","body":null,"source":"CBS Sports","date":"2024-03-05T15:48:13.000Z","props":{"site_name":"CBSSports.com","title":"Mavericks vs. Pacers odds, line, spread, score prediction, time: 2024 NBA picks for March 5 from proven model","description":"SportsLine's model just revealed its NBA picks for Indiana Pacers vs. Dallas Mavericks on Tuesday","image":"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2023/11/10/822e8cae-edca-4128-b92b-dd31392052fe/thumbnail/1200x675/8885d9f35952cfd30552261419502129/usatsi-tyrese-haliburton-pacers.jpg","type":"article","url":"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/mavericks-vs-pacers-odds-line-spread-score-prediction-time-2024-nba-picks-for-march-5-from-proven-model/"},"language":"EN","created_at":"2024-03-05T16:06:33.631Z","hostname":"cbssports.com","id":"898514dac2dbe49431f4bbec83dec107"},{"_score":1.1117164,"title":"Big 12 Releases Brackets for Wrestling Championship – The Franchise","link":"https://thefranchiseok.com/big-12-releases-brackets-for-wrestling-championship/","description":null,"body":null,"source":"thefranchiseok.com","date":"2024-03-05T15:47:31.000Z","props":{},"language":"EN","created_at":"2024-03-05T16:10:25.451Z","hostname":"thefranchiseok.com","id":"373f2d0605524fbc31b9d03106488cc0"},{"_score":1.1192759,"title":" AGS Agunsa Partners with Omni, Bolstering Logistics and Transportation Capabilities ","link":"https://bnnbreaking.com/finance-nav/business/ags-agunsa-partners-with-omni-bolstering-logistics-and-transportation-capabilities","description":"AGS Agunsa announces a strategic investment in Omni, enhancing logistics and transportation services.

The easiest way to fix that, coming off the best year of Prescott's career in which he threw a league-leading 36 TD passes, is to make him the highest-paid player in NFL history. Something to the tune of a 5-year, $285 million extension ($57 million average per year) is what to expect. That is a $2 million per year increase over the last \"highest paid player of all time\" signing when Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow signed his contract last September. Here are the most recent mega-million-dollar QB signings:● 9/7/23 - Joe Burrow, Bengals - 5 years, $275 million ($55 million per year) ● 7/26/23 - Justin Herbert, Chargers - 5 years, $262.5 million ($52.5m) ● 5/4/23 - Lamar Jackson, Ravens - 5 years, $260 million ($52m) ● 4/18/23 - Jalen Hurts, Eagles - 5 years, $255 million ($51m) ● 9/1/22 - Russell Wilson, Broncos - 5 years, $245 million ($49m)Denver is now biting the bullet on Wilson's deal, cutting the 35-year-old 9-time Pro Bowler after two seasons in which he had an 11-19 record. The Broncos are now absorbing an $85 million salary cap hit over the next two years for their mistake.Wilson's contract is an example of the risk involved in committing this kind of money to one player. But it's the price of doing quarterback business in the NFL. And if Jerry Jones is truly committed to being \"all in\" in 2024, the Dak deal needs to be done now so that the Cowboys can do business next week.","source":"CBS News","date":"2024-03-05T15:38:03.000Z","props":{"type":"article","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/texas/news/dak-prescott-contact-dallas-cowboys-nfl/","title":"New dad Dak Prescott set to become NFL's highest-paid player","description":"After a career-best season, expect Dak Prescott's new contract to be about $57 million per year, Bill Jones writes.","image":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/12/23/4198b5eb-762f-4a4b-bf57-617fa7eb3096/thumbnail/1200x630g2/b4ac3c55d8fe1202bbd4b1298743cff8/gettyimages-1741208395.jpg?v=bc5d8c67ac570dce258200b20849fb01","image:width":"1200","image:height":"630","video:url":"https://cbsn-dal.cbsnstream.cbsnews.com/out/v1/ffa98bbf7d2b4c038c229bd4d9122708/master_6.m3u8","video:secure_url":"https://cbsn-dal.cbsnstream.cbsnews.com/out/v1/ffa98bbf7d2b4c038c229bd4d9122708/master_6.m3u8","video:type":"application/x-mpegURL","video:width":"1920","video:height":"1080"},"language":"EN","created_at":"2024-03-05T16:05:54.910Z","hostname":"cbsnews.com","id":"6cf785b934e97318d34e86f86bf8eb20"},{"_score":1.1202145,"title":"Bitcoin surpasses $69,000 mark, beating record of $68,991 in Nov 2021 | Mint","link":"https://www.livemint.com/market/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-surpasses-69-000-mark-beating-record-of-68-991-in-nov-2021-11709652739298.html","description":"The price of Bitcoin soared to $69,191.94, surpassing its previous record of $68,991 set in November 2021.","body":"Bitcoin surged to an all-time high surpassing $69,000, driven by increased accessibility for trading and constrained supplies of the world's largest cryptocurrency, on Tuesday. The price of Bitcoin soared to $69,191.94, surpassing its previous record of $68,991 set in November 2021.This surge was propelled by investors channeling funds into U.S. spot exchange-traded cryptocurrency products and the anticipation of potential declines in global interest rates.Following the approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs by the Securities and Exchange Commission in late January, investor interest has surged. However, the market subsequently experienced a downturn, with Bitcoin trading lower. Presently, Bitcoin is priced at $68,440.Also read: Bitcoin surge: Why should you still not invest in cryptos? These are 7 key reasonsBitcoin's staggering surge of almost 160% since October, with a remarkable 44% spike occurring solely in February, presents a stark juxtaposition to the crypto winter of 2022. During that period, the market endured an 18-month-long downturn characterized by notable corporate bankruptcies and scandals.The resurgence of Bitcoin, along with the broader crypto market, can be attributed not only to increased demand from a more diverse investor base but also to the anticipation of the Federal Reserve's potential decision to reduce U.S. interest rates. Such moves often lead investors to redirect capital towards assets offering higher yields or exhibiting greater volatility.“The market is witnessing a notable resurgence, with Bitcoin's price reaching towards its record highs, accompanied by a significant influx of institutional investment, which are the primary catalysts for this upward trend. While meme coins are experiencing a transient upswing fueled by FOMO, the true drivers of this rally remain established players like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are attracting robust demand from major investors,” said Sumit Gupta, co-founder, CoinDCX.Gupta further added, “The introduction of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is fundamentally altering the market landscape by providing a more accessible and secure avenue for individuals of diverse financial backgrounds to participate in the crypto ecosystem. These investment vehicles are unlocking significant latent demand for crypto, as evidenced by the rapid growth of BlackRock's bitcoin ETF. This particular fund has reached $10 billion in assets under management within such a short timeframe, with projections suggesting that the next $10 billion could be accumulated even faster. These developments strongly suggest that institutional adoption is playing a pivotal role in propelling the current crypto rally.”Also read: Crypto trading reaches 10-month high in India: ReportThis year, investors have shown a keen interest in cryptocurrencies, mega-cap technology stocks, and investment-grade corporate bonds, especially. Analysts suggest that bitcoin, in particular, has seen significant traction leading up to April's anticipated halving event. This event, occurring every four years, involves a reduction in the rate at which tokens are released, along with the rewards granted to miners.The total supply of bitcoin is capped at 21 million, with approximately 19 million already mined, according to reports. Despite its recent surge in popularity, many investors remain wary of bitcoin due to its high volatility and perceived lack of substantial real-world applications beyond speculative investment.However, amidst a mix of factors such as increased inflows into Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), the anticipation of limited bitcoin supply, and potential future declines in U.S. interest rates, some companies are diversifying their corporate holdings by adding cryptocurrencies to their portfolios.&nbsp;","source":"Mint","date":"2024-03-05T15:37:35.000Z","props":{"title":"Bitcoin surpasses $69,000 mark, beating record of $68,991 in Nov 2021","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2024/03/05/1600x900/bitcoin_new_1709629428115_1709653021372.jpg","image:width":"1600","image:height":"900","type":"article","url":"https://www.livemint.com/market/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-surpasses-69-000-mark-beating-record-of-68-991-in-nov-2021-11709652739298.html","site_name":"mint","description":"The price of Bitcoin soared to $69,191.94, surpassing its previous record of $68,991 set in November 2021."},"language":"EN","created_at":"2024-03-05T16:11:46.072Z","hostname":"livemint.com","id":"9eee393e7ceb3fd097820c37f3889ecd"},{"_score":1.1222962,"title":"Source -- Jets expected to release veteran TE C.J.

In 2022, the company offered free donuts to all customers on midterm Election Day. In another giveaway in 2021, Krispy Kreme handed out free donuts to over 1.5 million Americans who presented a valid COVID vaccination card at participating locations. They've also given out free donuts on Leap Day, on World Kindness Day last fall, to anyone with a losing lottery ticket in August 2023, and to students graduating last spring.On Super Tuesday, Republican primaries or caucuses are being held in Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont and Virginia. Fourteen of these states — all but Alaska — are also holding Democratic contests, as is the U.S. territory of American Samoa, and the Iowa Democratic caucus results are also expected. The states have different voting hours and some allow people to register to vote at the polls.

Bloomberg contributed $3 billion to support the arts, education, environment, public health, and programs aimed at improving city governments around the world, while the Knights gave $1.24 billion, including support for the University of Oregon and an ambitious poverty-fighting effort in Portland, Oregon. The Dells contributed nearly $976 million to their charitable funds, which distribute gifts to a wide array of charities. For the first time, Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates appear separately on the list — she at No. 9 and he at No. 16. And all three co-founders of Home Depot are on the list — Bernie Marcus at No. 10, Ken Langone at No. 12, and Arthur Blank at No. 21. Together, the 50 donors on the list contributed a total of $11.9 billion to charity in 2023. The median amount they gave was $100 million. While those numbers are sizable, not all of the nation’s wealthiest people appear on the list. Only 23 of the richest Americans on the Forbes 400 list donated enough to appear on the Philanthropy rankings. “We still see the majority of wealth holders on the sideline,” says Renee Kaplan, CEO of Forward Global, which advises wealthy individuals on their giving. “More resources need to be unlocked.” Among those who gave big — but are less well known — were: — Franklin Antonio, an early employee of chipmaker Qualcomm, is No. 6. He bequeathed $400 million to the Summer Science Program and to the SETI Institute, which seeks to detect evidence of life elsewhere in the universe. — Ohio investor Hugh Hoffman, at No. 11, left $231.7 million to the ALS Association, University of Cincinnati Foundation, Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden, Cincinnati Nature Center, Yale University, and other groups. — Boston’s Tim Springer and Chafen Lu, academics and researchers, were early investors in Moderna. At No. 13 on the list, they contributed $210 million to the Institute for Protein Innovation, which shares its data with scientists for free. — At No. 23, San Diego’s Jay Kahn worked in the clothing industry for many years and was an early investor in Price Club and Apple. He bequeathed $106 million to the San Diego Foundation. While foundations created by the donors and colleges and universities were the biggest recipients of last year’s gifts, many donors supported a diverse range of causes that included: — Researching Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases: The Lauder family, at No. 14, contributed $200 million to the Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation. Recipients of Google co-founder Sergey Brin’s $67.3 million, No. 34, included the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research. — Fighting antisemitism: Businessman and New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, No. 24, committed $100 million to expand the work of the Foundation to Combat Antisemitism. — Helping women and girls: Recipients of Lucia Woods Lindley’s $63 million in donations, No. 35, included the Ms. Foundation for Women and the Chicago Foundation for Women. — Understanding artificial intelligence: At No. 36, David and Kathleen LaCross awarded $57 million to the University of Virginia Darden School of Business, which will support an extensive A.I. program. And, at No. 8, eBay founder Pierre Omidyar and his wife, Pam, awarded $264 million in donations, including a contribution to the AI Collaborative, a nonprofit that distributes funds to ensure A.I. advances the public interest. The next wave of megadonors, people in their 40s, 50s, and 60s, has begun to emerge, signaling a changing of the guard in philanthropy. They are likely to dominate the next 20 to 30 years of major giving, and they’re different from their predecessors. They’re less interested in giving huge donations to big institutions like universities and hospitals. Causes including the environment, social justice, and scientific research drive their giving: They want to create tangible change in the world. The next generation is hands-on with their giving. Some are deeply analytical, like John and Laura Arnold (No. 5). John, who ran his own hedge fund, and Laura, a lawyer, look for policy areas, such as criminal justice and health care, that have been largely ignored and where big breakthroughs are possible — even if they take a decade or more. “It became very clear to us that if we really wanted to address injustice as manifested in the educational system, we needed to really think about the systemic issues that led to that dysfunction outside of the educational system,” Laura Arnold says. Wendy Schmidt and her husband, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, (No. 7) hope to change broken systems, especially when it comes to environmental problems like climate change. Many next-generation donors’ vehicles for giving vary. They’re not wedded to having a traditional foundation. Some use donor-advised funds or a limited-liability company. They might use a 501(c)(4) to include political donations as part of a bigger strategy. Or a combination of approaches. “Younger people coming into wealth that are under 50, the majority of them are not interested in big institutional philanthropy. They don’t even like the word philanthropist,” says Kaplan, the giving adviser. “They consider themselves change agents, social entrepreneurs, or community partners.” Among the other findings from the report: — When they start giving big: Four of the donors on the Philanthropy 50 are under 40. The youngest donor is 34-year-old Jeff Sobrato, a real-estate investor. — Where they live: Fifteen top donors live in California, seven in New York, five in Florida, four in Texas, and three each in Virginia and Washington. Thirty-four states and the District of Columbia have no donors on the list. — Where they give: Twenty recipients of donations from the largest donors are based in California, 12 in New York, 11 in Hawaii, seven in Ohio, five in Virginia, and four in Massachusetts. — How they became wealthy: Donors with ties to the financial industry were most frequently on the list (10 donors with $2.2 billion in contributions); followed by those who earned fortunes in technology (nine donors with $2.6 billion in donations), and real estate (six donors with $397 million in contributions). _____ Maria Di Mento is a senior reporter and Jim Rendon is a senior writer at the Chronicle of Philanthropy, where you can read the full article.

The Mavericks (34-27) and Pacers (34-28) have almost identical records heading into the contest. Indiana defeated Dallas in the teams&#8217; most recent meeting on February 25, so the Mavs are looking to rebound. Luka Doncic, however, is dealing with an injury concern.\nDoncic has battled through some injury trouble in recent games. Mavs head coach Jason Kidd has been vocal about Luka&#8217;s toughness throughout the 2023-24 season. With that being said, Dallas will still approach the situation with caution.\nSo is Luka Doncic playing tonight vs. the Pacers?\n*Watch NBA games LIVE with fuboTV (click for a free trial)*\nLuka Doncic&#8217;s injury status vs. Pacers\nJerome Miron-USA TODAY Sports\nDoncic is currently listed as questionable with a right ankle sprain, via the NBA Injury Report.\nThe Mavs are obviously hopeful that Luka can play against this talented Pacers team. Dallas has dropped four of their past five contests after previously winning seven games in a row. They would love to win the final two games of their current homestand against the Pacers and Miami Heat.\nLuka Doncic&#8217;s availability will go a long way toward determining the outcome of both games, though.\nOn Monday at practice, Jason Kidd addressed the Mavericks&#8217; game against the Pacers. Indiana&#8217;s offense, which is led by superstar Tyrese Haliburton, will test the Mavericks&#8217; defense.\n&#8220;Offensively they are one of the best,&#8221; Kidd said of the Pacers. &#8220;Haliburton is playing at a high level, (Myles) Turner is playing well. Again, the transition defense is going to be tested. Our defense will be tested.\n&#8220;And then offensively, we’ve gotta be prepared for Rick (Carlisle) to double-team (Kyrie Irving) and Luka. And other guys being able to step up and make shots.&#8221;\nTuesday&#8217;s game should be exciting. Both teams will look for their stars to lead the way, but whichever side gets more help from its depth could end up emerging victorious.\nWhen it comes to the question of if Luka Doncic is playing tonight vs. the Pacers, though, the answer is uncertain at the moment.","source":"ClutchPoints","date":"2024-03-05T15:35:29.000Z","props":{"locale":"en_US","type":"article","title":"Mavericks' Luka Doncic injury update for Pacers game","description":"Luka Doncic received a pivotal injury update ahead of the Dallas Mavericks' game on Tuesday night against the Indiana Pacers.","category":"NBA","url":"https://clutchpoints.com/mavericks-news-luka-doncic-injury-update-pacers-game","site_name":"ClutchPoints | Dallas Mavericks News","image":"https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Mavericks_news_Luka_Doncic_injury_update_for_Pacers_game.webp","image:width":"1200","image:height":"673","image:type":"image/webp"},"language":"EN","created_at":"2024-03-05T16:06:33.807Z","hostname":"clutchpoints.com","id":"3599260ea003e3fc29c93e43ca136edd"},{"_score":1.1147689,"title":"Connecting dots: Why Kirk Cousins is likely leaving Vikings - ESPN","link":"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/39658429/why-kirk-cousins-likely-done-minnesota-vikings-free-agent-atlanta-falcons","description":"While Cousins and the Vikings have said they'd like to stay together, several factors suggest he's probably done in Minnesota.","body":null,"source":"ESPN","date":"2024-03-05T15:35:00.000Z","props":{"site_name":"ESPN.com","url":"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/39658429/why-kirk-cousins-likely-done-minnesota-vikings-free-agent-atlanta-falcons","title":"Connecting the dots: Why Kirk Cousins' time with the Vikings is likely coming to an end","description":"While Cousins and the Vikings have said they'd like to stay together, several factors suggest he's probably done in Minnesota.","image":"https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0305%2Fr1300288_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg","image:width":"1296","image:height":"729","type":"article"},"language":"EN","created_at":"2024-03-05T17:27:19.318Z","hostname":"espn.com","id":"f22d12d8755285fb0f6979e28bdb0a19"},{"_score":1.1275613,"title":"Facebook, Instagram Users Report Massive Outage | Fairfield Daily Voice","link":"https://dailyvoice.com/connecticut/fairfield/facebook-instagram-meta-outage/","description":"Facebook and Instagram users were locked out of their accounts Tuesday morning, March 5 in what appears to be a widespread outage.Hundreds and thousands of both Facebook and Instagram users had reported problems on DownDetector as of 11 a.…","body":"Facebook and Instagram users were locked out of their accounts Tuesday morning, March 5 in what appears to be a widespread outage. \nHundreds and thousands of both Facebook and Instagram users had reported problems on DownDetector as of 11 a.m. \nThe Meta website said only that the WhatsApp API was experiencing major disruptions, but nothing for Facebook or Instagram \n\n\n\nIs it just me or facebook logged me out? — Secret Razzie (@RealRazzieBinx) March 5, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\nEverybody checking twitter to see if facebook is down for everyone else #facebookdown pic.twitter.com/Yq1WTsfsqp — Pizza Dad (@Pizza__Dad) March 5, 2024\n\n\nThis is a developing story.

From a leadership position in the IDF to being a Principal at i3 Equity Partners, Bentzi has a wealth of experience spanning various industry verticals. In our conversation, we delved into the current state of institutional , the problems enterprises face when adopting crypto, and possible solutions. Hope you enjoy. Bentzi Rabi Utila crypto wallets Welcome, Bentzi. Let’s kick this off with Utila’s origin story and vision. Sure. Utila’s journey began with a realization that my co-founder, Sam, and I had after studying, experimenting, and building in the cybersecurity and asset management space for many years. Enterprises and institutional players are increasingly adopting digital assets like crypto. Especially since spot BTC ETFs went live and ETH ETFs became more evident than before. For context, we have secured transactions worth $3+ billion in the last six months or so. But there’s a big gap when it comes to secure, user-friendly, and versatile wallets or asset management infrastructure for these enterprises. They’re forced to rely on providers that are too complex and not flexible enough. Complicated and lengthy onboarding processes, sub-par UI/UX, steep learning curves are some of the major challenges for institutions trying to manage their crypto holdings efficiently. This can’t go on. So, we built Utila to offer a secure, no-fuss, self-serving, and all-inclusive wallet platform that understands and meets the demands of enterprise-grade crypto-asset management. You’ve been a proponent of non-custodial solutions for enterprises. Please explain why and how that’s significant. We say— But so far, we didn’t have the tools to help enterprises adopt and implement this powerful idea efficiently. not your keys, not your crypto. Entities with massive holdings have little or no control over their digital assets when working with legacy custodians. This slows them down and increases operational and counterparty risks. Privacy is also at stake in low-trust, multi-stakeholder environments where institutions mostly operate. Their interactions involve highly sensitive data, and even minor breaches result in tremendous costs—monetary and otherwise. Scalable, self-custody options, on the contrary, put enterprises in the driving seat. With platforms like Utila, they can enjoy the seamless, hassle-free nature of legacy asset management along with the security and robustness of cryptography, decentralization, etc. They get autonomy, above all, which is a big competitive edge in today’s world and business scenario. Did any particular technological development help enable self-custody at scale for enterprises? Yes, of course. Solving the so-called Trilemma was a core technical challenge. You couldn’t have security, scalability, and usability at once. Recently, however, innovations in Multi-Party Computation (MPC) changed the game. We fully capitalized on this opportunity to build Utila. Using MPC, we found a way to let enterprises generate ‘private keys’ and sign transactions securely without the hassle of Common Line Interface (CLI) and so on. That handles seamlessness under the hood. But an intuitive frontend was the other key piece in the puzzle. It wouldn’t be possible to build this a few years ago, mainly because we didn’t have developers with the required skill set. Now, we have talented people and tools to abstract complex mechanisms and create a rich UX/UI for users without giving up critical features. With that, we could combine the best of legacy and novel frameworks. The outcome: an end-to-end asset management ecosystem for crypto-native enterprises and institutions. Before we wrap, where do you see institutional crypto adoption in the next 3-5 years? And how would that impact the industry overall? I’m very bullish and for various reasons. We, as an industry, are focusing more on the fundamentals than short-term price movements and market dynamics. They’re important markers, no doubt, but there’s much more to blockchain and crypto than speculation. Especially if we want to build sustainable frameworks that last and actually contribute to a better, more equitable world. Utila, for one, is all about using innovation to redefine how value is created, stored, and transacted at scale. We take this mission very seriously because it can set new standards for the future. Institutional adoption is super important for crypto’s long-term success. While retail participation is the daily bread and butter, bigger entities help solidify the ground upon which new things are built. We’re currently in a similar position as Web2 was in the early-2000s. In the next 3-5 years, we’ll see a significant rise in crypto-based mass market use cases. That too, without the downsides of the Web2-led tech boom, i.e., security and privacy concerns, etc. But to achieve that goal, we must work together instead of against each other.

But it remains reluctant to cut off military aid.","body":"President Joe Biden is trying to ramp up political pressure on Israel’s government to allow in more humanitarian aid and rein in its offensive in the Gaza Strip but has stopped short of cutting off weapons deliveries to America’s main ally in the Middle East, current and former officials say. Reluctant to enter into a full-blown confrontation with Israel, the Biden administration instead has air dropped humanitarian aid for Palestinian civilians and held talks in Washington with a political rival of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Benny Gantz. It has also stepped up public criticism of Israel’s tactics in Gaza — though, as NBC News has reported, apparently not as much Vice President Kamala Harris would like. Dismayed at the plight of Palestinian civilians and with no let-up in the Israeli campaign, the White House National Security Council asked the Pentagon in recent weeks for possible options to get more aid into Gaza by air, land and sea, two administration officials told NBC News.  Based on the Pentagon’s advice, the president opted for air drops of aid and U.S. aircraft over the weekend began dropping pallets of food and other supplies on parachutes just off Gaza’s coast. On Tuesday, three U.S. Air Force planes dropped 60 bundles with 36,000 meals, accompanied by four Jordanian planes that dropped additional supplies, said a U.S. official, and more deliveries are expected. The administration’s “soft power” approach emphasizing humanitarian relief is shaped by both the domestic political pressure Biden is under at home to help stop the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, as well as a pragmatic belief that focusing on aid is the president’s best option while delicate negotiations continue to secure a six-week ceasefire deal, current and former officials said. The U.S. military has carried out air drops in other conflicts over the decades, helping Kurds facing attacks from Saddam Hussein’s regime in Iraq, Bosnian Muslims besieged by Serb forces in eastern Bosnia and civilians under assault by Islamic State group militants in Iraq and Syria. But the air drops over Gaza were unusual, with the U.S. launching the operation to assist civilians affected by a military offensive carried out by an ally armed by Washington. Vice President Harris delivered blunt criticism of Israel on Sunday, marking the latest in a series of critical comments from the White House over the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Gaza. NBC News reported that the original draft of her speech contained much harsher language before it was softened by the White House National Security Council. Yet her public condemnation was still notable, and foreshadowed what will likely be more criticism from the president in his State of the Union address later this week. “People in Gaza are starving. The conditions are inhumane and our common humanity compels us to act,” Harris said at an event marking the 59th anniversary of Bloody Sunday in Alabama. “The Israeli government must do more to significantly increase the flow of aid. No excuses,” she said. A maritime corridor? Apart from more air drops, the administration is looking at other options to move more food and aid into Gaza, including possibly building a floating dock or makeshift causeway off the coast of the enclave to enable ships to deliver humanitarian supplies, a U.S. official said. Such an undertaking likely would require other countries or international agencies to secure the area and ferry aid to shore, as the administration has ruled out any presence of American troops in Gaza. Referring to a possible “maritime assistance corridor,” State Department spokesperson Miller told reporters that “we are in discussion with a number of partners about this initiative and while it is still in the development phase, we are optimistic about its potential to supplement our air and land efforts.” Expanding humanitarian access to Gaza will be at the top of the agenda when Secretary of State Antony Blinken meets Gantz on Tuesday, with the secretary planning to appeal for the opening of the key Erez crossing, Miller said. The distribution of aid within Gaza, especially in the enclave’s north, continues to pose a challenge after civilians were killed as they rushed an aid convoy. The U.S. has told Israel that the security situation must be addressed and Palestinian civilians cannot be allowed to starve. “We will be happy to work with Israel and with the United Nations to find the best alternative to ensure that those trucks can safely deliver their food, their water their medicine,” Miller said, “but an unacceptable answer is leaving those trucks just sitting in warehouses and not getting the aid distributed to the people who desperately need it.” Opening the door to Netanyahu’s rival  Some administration officials say the Israeli government is starting to listen to the administration’s view that the way the war is unfolding is damaging for Israel over the long term. Israeli officials say they remain grateful for the support of U.S. officials as they continue to try to destroy Hamas. Privately some of them have said they are worried by the criticism from the Biden administration. “The Americans are not being very nice to us,” a senior Israeli government official said. Netanyahu in his public statements has been adamant that he is not taking orders from outside of Israel on how to continue the war. Many Democrats in Congress and foreign governments say the administration needs to bring more pressure to bear on Israel. They argue that only a threat to cut off military aid or to withdraw diplomatic support for Israel at the United Nations will persuade Netanyahu to scale back the offensive in Gaza and open up access for humanitarian convoys. “What remains is we’ve got a profound contradiction that we have to face directly: we have a situation where the U.S. is airdropping aid on day one, and Israel is dropping bombs on day two,” Democratic Sen. Peter Welch of Vermont told NBC News. “And the American taxpayer is paying for the aid and the bombs.” Welch added that “essentially what you’ve got is the Prime Minister (of Israel) asking us for money and rejecting our advice.” “And the big question is, from my perspective, whether the president needs to get more aggressive with Netanyahu,” he said. Another senator from Biden’s party, Chris Murphy of Connecticut, said there was a growing risk that Israel’s and America’s national interests were diverging, unless Netanyahu shifted course. Murphy said, “There has to be a rapid serious change in direction of Israel’s policy, or our national security interest and Benjamin Netanyahu’s interests are going to clearly be in fundamentally different places.” Although it has refrained from issuing ultimatums to Israel, the Biden administration on Monday welcomed to Washington a member of Netanyahu’s war cabinet, Gantz, a centrist seen as the prime minister’s main political opponent. Opinion polls show Gantz’s National Unity party gaining ground against the prime minister’s Likud party. A Netanyahu ally, Dudi Amsalem, a minister from the Likud party, slammed Gantz for traveling to Washington. Writing on the social media platform X, he said Americans likely view Gantz as the person “to lead the process of a Palestinian state and the cessation of fighting in Gaza.” And he added: “You entered the emergency government to create a consensus during wartime ... not to stop the [Israel Defense Forces] from winning the war.” But the administration sees maintaining a channel with Gantz as a way of possibly shaping Israel’s decision-making and keeping options open for the future, former officials said. “We have been dealing with all members of the war cabinet, including Mr. Gantz,” White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said. “We see this as a natural outgrowth of those discussions. We’re not going to turn away that sort of opportunity.” The State Department said Monday that the U.S. continues to supply weapons to Israel because the Hamas leaders behind the Oct. 7 terror attacks, the worst in Israel’s history, are still at large. “They would relaunch the attacks of October 7, today, tomorrow if they had the capability to do so,” Matthew Miller, the State Department spokesperson, told reporters. “So we support Israel’s legitimate military campaign consistent with international humanitarian law.” Aiming for a ceasefire deal Despite the mourning friction with Netanyahu, Biden remains an ardent supporter of Israel, shaped by his long career in the Senate and his emotional connection to the Jewish state and its history, former officials and analysts say. Biden has faced fierce criticism from younger progressives in the party and from Arab-Americans for his handling of the war in Gaza, with more than 100,000 voters in Michigan’s Democratic primary choosing “uncommitted” instead of Biden. But Biden’s team also is wary of providing any ammunition to Republicans or pro-Israel hawks that the president has in any way abandoned Israel. Most importantly, the administration believes that withholding military aid could prove counterproductive as the main objective now is to clinch a six-week ceasefire deal designed to stop the fighting and secure the release of dozens of hostages still held by Hamas, according to Aaron David Miller, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank. “The main reason in my view is Biden understands he needs to make a difference, not a point,” Miller said. “And the difference is this: without an Israel-Hamas ceasefire, which would allow surging humanitarian aid into Gaza, a suspension of Israeli military activities, the release of the women, the elderly and the sick hostages, you might as well hang the ‘closed for the season’ sign on American policy.

With construction under way, the company expects to bring miners online at the site in Q2 2024.  The Culberson County site creates the optionality for the company to expand its self-mining fleet or to transition existing self-mining activity from Granbury, Texas and Kearney, Neb. to the site. The site is expected to have up to approximately 3.6 EH/s of self-mining capacity if current generation miners are deployed. Based on current energy price forecasts, the company expects that its cost to mine a Bitcoin at the Culberson County site will be approximately 30 percent lower than its cost to mine a Bitcoin through its hosted miners at Granbury, Texas and Kearney, Neb.  &quot;The Culberson County project exemplifies Hut 8's focus on operating excellence,&quot; said Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot. &quot;Our in-house development team enables us to build quickly and cost-effectively. Compared to the benchmark of approximately $460,000 per MW set by recent acquisitions in the area, our all-in cost to design and build the Culberson County site is expected to be less than $275,000 per MW. This represents a savings of more than 40 percent, or approximately $18,500,000 in upfront development costs per every 100 MW of expansion. For the Culberson County site specifically, this means that we expect to build the site for $17,300,000 or less, instead of approximately $29,000,000.&quot;  The company also has formally enacted a new treasury strategy that provides for the use of Bitcoin held in reserve to build balance sheet value and finance growth initiatives. Bitcoin held in reserve may be deployed through direct sales, option strategies or other approaches. The strategy is designed to enhance the company's ability to execute strategic initiatives, increase its operating scale and optimize metrics such as energy cost and cost to mine a Bitcoin. Decisions to utilize Bitcoin held in reserve will be made on a case-by-case basis. The company will use this strategy to fund capital expenditures for the Culberson County site.  &quot;Breaking ground at the Culberson County site marks the introduction of Hut 8's new treasury strategy, which focuses on deploying our stack strategically to grow the business, create shareholder value and minimize dilution,&quot; said Genoot. &quot;As we head into the halving, we anticipate that distressed assets will become available at favorable valuations and create opportunities for further growth. A core principle of our new strategy is to deploy capital thoughtfully and strategically to maintain a strong balance sheet and position ourselves to evaluate these opportunities as they arise.&quot;  About Hut 8  Through innovation, imagination and passion, Hut 8 Corp.'s executive team is bullish on creating value at the intersection of infrastructure and energy through Bitcoin mining and hosting, groundbreaking managed services, energy arbitrage, operating traditional data centers and capitalizing on emerging technologies like AI and machine learning. Headquartered in Miami, Fla., Hut 8 Corp.'s infrastructure portfolio includes 11 sites: five high performance computing data centers across British Columbia and Ontario that offer cloud, co-location, AI, machine learning and VFX rendering computing solutions; and six Bitcoin mining, hosting and managed services sites located in Alberta, N.Y., Nebraska and Texas. Long-distinguished for its unique treasury strategy, Hut 8 Corp. has one of the highest inventories of self-mined Bitcoin of any publicly-traded company globally.
